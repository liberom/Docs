# Databases

Databases are applications that help us store data in a flexible and powerful
way, and they have been around ever since the 1960s.

Almost all web applications use database in one way or the other in order to
store all the data they need to deal with. The allow us to store and find data
in flexible, and very efficient ways.

Nowadays there are lots of different types of databases, but we'll focus on the
most prevalent, traditional type of databases. These are called "relational
databases" (or [RDBMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system)).
