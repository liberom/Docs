# Webapps For Beginners

*[Ruby Monday Study Group](http://rubymonstas.org) curriculum for intermediates*

This book has been written after we have run 4 beginners groups at our [Ruby
Monstas](http://rubymonstas.org) groups in Berlin, which then turn into
intermediate groups. It outlines the current state of our intermediate group
curriculum.

After completing this curriculum you'll have a basic understanding how browsers
talk to web applications, and how web applications respond. You'll be able to
generate dynamic web pages, and build simple web applications.
