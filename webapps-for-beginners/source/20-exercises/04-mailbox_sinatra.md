# Mailbox via Sinatra

## Exercise 4.1

After you've read the chapters about <a href="/sinatra.html">Sinatra</a> write
a little Sinatra application that reads emails from a CSV file, and renders
an HTML table using ERB.

Feel free to copy your solution to
<a href="http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/exercises/mailbox_csv.html">Ruby for Beginners, exercise 15.1</a>
for this, and wrap it into a new Sinatra application.

However, make it so that whenever the CSV file is changed, the application
picks this up (and displays the change) without having to restart the
application.
