# Rack

<a href="http://rack.github.io/">Rack</a> is the most basic way to build a very
simple web application in Ruby, and we are going to start with it.

In practice you may never build an application with Rack directly, but you'll use
it when you work on Sinatra or Rails applications, since these use Rack under
the hood.
