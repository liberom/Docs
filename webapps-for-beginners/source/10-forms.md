# Forms

*Talking back*

So far, all that our little application can do is return some HTML when asked.
I.e. it can respond to `GET` requests by returning HTML.

What if we want to talk back to our application, and send some data from the
browser to it? You have seen this a million times, there are those little forms
on websites that let you enter data and somehow submit it.

So, how does that work?
