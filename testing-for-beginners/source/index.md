# Testing For Beginners

*[Ruby Monday Study Group](http://rubymonstas.org) curriculum for advanced intermediates*

This book teaches the basics of testing software.

It has been written after we have run several groups at our [Ruby
Monstas](http://rubymonstas.org) groups in Berlin over the course of 4 years.
These groups start as beginners groups, learning [Ruby](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/),
then turn into intermediate groups learning the basics of building
[web applications](http://webapps-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/).
They normally then start building their first Rails application as
a group, and get in touch with the concept of testing.

After completing this book you'll have a basic understanding of:

* Why writing tests is a good thing.
* What concepts are relevant for writing tests.
* What libraries exist for making writing tests easy.
* What services can be used to help with your tests and code quality.
