# Custom Matchers

We've talked a bit about matchers before, and briefly mentioned that RSpec
even allows us to define our own custom matchers.

Let's have a quick look at this.

Here is the code that we have so far:

```ruby
require "date"

def leap_year?(year)
  year % 400 == 0 or year % 100 != 0 and year % 4 == 0
end

class User
  def initialize(name, birthday)
    @name = name
    @birthday = birthday
  end

  def name
    @name
  end

  def born_in_leap_year?
    leap_year?(Date.parse(@birthday).year)
  end
end

describe User do
  subject { User.new("Francisca", "#{year}-01-01") }

  context "born in 2001" do
    let(:year) { 2001 }
    it { should_not be_born_in_leap_year }
  end

  context "born in 1900" do
    let(:year) { 1900 }
    it { should_not be_born_in_leap_year }
  end

  context "born in 2000" do
    let(:year) { 2000 }
    it { should be_born_in_leap_year }
  end

  context "born in 2004" do
    let(:year) { 2004 }
    it { should be_born_in_leap_year }
  end
end
```

Now, what if we want to specify (test) the `name` method?

We could simply add the following test, using the basic style:

```ruby
describe User do
  subject { User.new("Francisca", "#{year}-01-01") }

  context "born in 2001" do
    it "returns the name" do
      expect(subject.name).to eq "Francisca"
    end

    it { should_not be_born_in_leap_year }
  end
end
```

However, we'd mix styles here. That's not a bad thing, really! But wouldn't it
be cool if we could say this instead?

```ruby
describe User do
  subject { User.new("Francisca", "#{year}-01-01") }

  context "born in 2001" do
    let(:year) { 2001 }
    it { should be_named("Francisca") }
    it { should_not be_born_in_leap_year }
  end
end
```

If we were to execute this, RSpec would try to call the method `named?` on our
`User` instance (just like `be_born_in_leap_year` calls `born_in_leap_year?` on
the user), and that method does not exist. We could add that method `named?` to
our `User` class, but we don't really want to add any such methods to our real
code, just so we can make the tests prettier.

Instead, we can define a [custom matcher](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/v/2-4/docs/custom-matchers/define-matcher)
`be_named` that inspects the user's `name`:

```ruby
RSpec::Matchers.define(:be_named) do |expected|
  match do |object|
    object.name == expected
  end
end
```

Hmmmm, ... apparently a matcher is a block that calls a method `match` that
takes another block. The actual and expected values are passed as arguments to
the two blocks, somehow. Inside the inner block we are supposed to return
`true` or `false` depending if the matcher is supposed to "match".

Ok, well, we don't really have to understand how exactly this works in 
detailâ€”we can just slap it at the end of our file, and run it:

```
$ rspec --format doc user_spec.rb

User
  born in 2001
    should be named "Francisca"
    should not be born in leap year

Finished in 0.00267 seconds (files took 0.15704 seconds to load)
2 examples, 0 failures
```

Yay!

Now, how cool is that.

With those five lines of Ruby code we've extended RSpec to include a matcher
that is pretty specific to our code. And now we can use the advanced style
in order to test our `name` method.
